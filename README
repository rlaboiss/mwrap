MWrap
=====

MWrap is an interface generation system in the spirit of SWIG or matwrap.
From a set of augmented MATLAB script files, MWrap will generate a MEX gateway to desired C/C++/Fortran function calls and MATLAB function files to access that gateway.
It makes wrapping C/C++/Fortran from MATLAB almost pleasant!
The details of converting to and from MATLAB's data structures, and of
allocating and freeing temporary storage, are hidden from the user. It is also compatible with modern Octave via `mkoctfile --mex`.

Dependencies
------------

Building MWrap requires the following tools:

* A C compiler with C99 support and a C++ compiler with C++11 support
* [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) and [Flex](https://github.com/westes/flex)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.16 or newer (for the CMake build path)
* (Optional) [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) with MEX build tooling when compiling wrappers with CMake

If you are using a Debian or Ubuntu based system, the required packages can be
installed via

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential bison flex cmake
```

CMake build
-----------

Create a build directory and run CMake:

```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Cache options mirror the `make.inc` file.  For example, to enable
MATLAB `classdef` support and the C99 complex helpers:

```
cmake -DMWRAP_ENABLE_MATLAB_CLASSDEF=ON -DMWRAP_ENABLE_C99_COMPLEX=ON ..
```

### Building the MATLAB/Octave examples

The example wrappers under `example/` can be generated through CMake by turning
on the `MWRAP_BUILD_EXAMPLES` option.  This configuration runs `mwrap` to
produce the C++ gateway sources (and any requested MATLAB scaffolding).
By default the build stops after source generation, mirroring the legacy
Makefiles.  The resulting files live under the build tree in per-example
subdirectories.

```
cmake -DMWRAP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON ..
cmake --build . --target mwrap_examples
```

To have CMake invoke MATLAB's compiler and produce loadable MEX binaries, add
`-DMWRAP_COMPILE_MEX=ON` when configuring.  CMake will build the generated
sources into MEX targets, attach them to the `mwrap_examples` aggregate target,
and skip executing the binaries during the build.

When running the MATLAB smoke tests locally (for example, `ctest -R matlab-`),
build the `mwrap_examples` target beforehand so that the generated wrappers and
MEX binaries are available to the test runner.

The `MWRAP_MEX_BACKEND` cache entry selects which toolchain to use.  MATLAB
backends require CMake's `FindMatlab` module to locate MATLAB's development
components, while Octave backends require the `mkoctfile` executable to be
available.  Choosing `ALL` emits binaries for both environments (and therefore
requires both toolchains).

```
cmake -DMWRAP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DMWRAP_COMPILE_MEX=ON -DMWRAP_MEX_BACKEND=MATLAB ..
cmake -DMWRAP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DMWRAP_COMPILE_MEX=ON -DMWRAP_MEX_BACKEND=OCTAVE ..
cmake -DMWRAP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DMWRAP_COMPILE_MEX=ON -DMWRAP_MEX_BACKEND=ALL ..
```

If you leave `MWRAP_COMPILE_MEX` disabled, you can still invoke MATLAB or
Octave's `mex` tool manually using the produced `.cc` file and any support
sources that your project requires.  Optional flags such as
`MWRAP_ENABLE_MATLAB_CLASSDEF` remain available while configuring the
examples.

Makefile build
--------------

Alternatively, edit `make.inc` and then run `make`.  The output will be a
standalone executable (`mwrap`) in the main directory.  Bison and Flex are
required for this build path.

Example usage
-------------

David Bindel's user's guide (`mwrap.pdf`) describes MWrap in detail; you can also look at the example subdirectories and the testing subdirectory to get some idea of how MWrap is used.

Alex Barnett also maintains a set of minimally complete tutorial examples of calling C/Fortran libraries (including OpenMP) from MATLAB/Octave, using MWrap, at https://github.com/ahbarnett/mwrapdemo
